% Section 1: Introduction
\section{Major Actions}
\begin{frame}{Actions Taken}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Deployed the website to Render: \url{https://frontend-e2jk.onrender.com/}
        \item Added more Quality Control features
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Updated the flaw-no flaw dropdown with a specific checklist item for each flaw
            \item Added the cursor auto focus on the relevant input field depending on the workflow
        \end{itemize}
        \item Fixed the pricing bug and had it so that a broken CPAP machine is half off while broken supplies are zero dollars
        \item Added Auto Clear functionality after UPCs are added
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Things to work on }
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Format the notes better so that they are easier to read
        \item Testing
        \item Uploading images to Pipedrive via their API
        \item Adding the Serial Number matching functionality
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Changes of Scope}
\begin{frame}{Changes of Scope}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The scope of the project has changed because I need to add the serial number tracking capability to the project and potentially connect it to assetpanda 
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\section{Measures}
\begin{frame}{Measures}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Percent of SKUs that have UPCs 
        \item Sales Cycle Time: This year, we've taken 24 hours on average between received and Ready to be paid, which in the future could be reduced to under 8 hours (within one workday)

    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Measures}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Number of SKUs that have been added to the system
        \item Number of SKUs that have been sold
        \item Number of SKUs that have been scanned

\section{Road Blocks}
\begin{frame}{Road Blocks}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Writing to a new Spreadsheet with each scan of a CPAP machine
        \item Connecting the Images to Pipedrive
        \begin{itemize}
            \item There may be problems with holding the images in my website because it would go over the data limits, so I'd either have to find a workaround or ditch the idea depending on how much space they are taking
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
