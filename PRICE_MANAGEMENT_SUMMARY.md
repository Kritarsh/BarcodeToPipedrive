# Price Management Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- **Added `Price` field** to `Inventory.js` and `Overstock.js` models
- **Month End models** already had `Price` field
- All models now store prices as `Number` type (double in MongoDB)

### 2. Pricing Logic Refactoring
- **New function**: `getPriceFromDatabase()` in `skuMatcher.js`
  - First checks if product has a database price
  - Falls back to pricing rules only for machines or when no DB price exists
  - Applies flaw adjustments to database prices
- **Updated**: All pricing calls in `server.js` to use `getPriceFromDatabase()`
- **Machines** still use pricing rules (no database entries)
- **Supplies** now use database prices when available

### 3. Backend API Endpoints
- **GET `/api/products/prices`**: Returns all products with pricing info
- **PUT `/api/products/:collection/:id/price`**: Updates price for specific product
- Price updates sync to both main and Month End collections

### 4. Frontend Price Management
- **New component**: `PriceManagement.js` with modern Tailwind UI
- **Dark mode support**: Automatically adapts to system light/dark mode preference
- **Full-width layout**: Uses full screen width for better table display
- **Features**:
  - Search and filter products by collection
  - Inline price editing
  - Real-time price updates
  - Error handling and loading states
  - Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### 5. Navigation Updates
- **New component**: `Navigation.js` for app-wide navigation with dark mode support
- **Updated**: `index.js` to include routing for price management
- **Updated**: `tailwind.config.js` to enable system-based dark mode
- Three main sections: Regular Inventory, Month End Inventory, Price Management

## Usage

### For Supplies (Inventory/Overstock items):
1. **New products**: Can specify price during creation, stored in database
2. **Existing products**: Use database price if available, otherwise fall back to pricing rules
3. **Price management**: Admin can update prices via `/price-management` page
4. **Flaw handling**: 
   - Flawed supplies = $0 (regardless of database price)
   - Good supplies = database price or calculated price

### For Machines:
1. **Always use pricing rules** (no database entries)
2. **Flaw handling**: Flawed machines = 50% of rule price
3. **Price management**: Not applicable (use pricing rules)

## Deployment Notes
- Existing data will have `Price: 0` by default
- Admin should update prices for existing products via the new interface
- Pricing rules remain as fallback for products without database prices
- Month End collections automatically sync price updates

## API Usage Examples
